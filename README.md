## Introduction

The 2022 FIFA World Cup was held in Qatar and was the 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup. The tournament was held from 20 November to 18 December 2022 and featured 32 teams from around the world competing for the ultimate prize in football. 

This edition of the World Cup was historic as it was the first time that the tournament was held in the Arab world and the first time it was held in November and December, instead of the traditional June and July. 

With a total of 64 matches played across 8 venues in 5 cities, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar provided a feast of football for fans around the world.

## Objective
